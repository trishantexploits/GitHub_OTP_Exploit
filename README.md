# GitHub_OTP_Exploit
A bug I found to exploit 2 factor authentication(OTP) on github.com
The video can be viewed on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk19A92gLGE).

## Vulnerability
The problem lies within the validation of the input that is obtained from the client. People can enter an input that would not be checked, and might force the server to send international messages to verify their phone numbers.
The select, i.e the drop down field has several options though, might not have extensions of certain countries, whereas if such an input is supplied to the server that is accepting inputs from that particular field might allow an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.

## Solution to reslove the conflicting issue
To resolve this issue one can add validation on either side, that is the server or the client to protect from this vulnerability. One can add an id value on the each field to identify each country individually and let the server check whether the obtained value was present in the field about which the form was provided or not, if not it can send an error to the client saying that the client sent an invalid input.

Anybody who tries to use this exploit would be *responsible* for themselves. Since, misutilization of this exploit might lead to damage to _intellectual property_ of *GitHub* as it has an attack vector that basically manipulates SMS, and could lead to sever damage since they would be international. Use this on your own risk.

#### I have submitted a request to official GitHub team to fix this problem and I hope it would be resolved soon.
