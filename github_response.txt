Hi Trishant,

Thanks for taking the time to share this with us.

While you're able to add an SMS number from an unlisted country through d=
ifferent means, it still isn't [officially supported](https://help.github=
.com/en/articles/countries-where-sms-authentication-is-supported).

Countries that are not officially supported by our SMS providers are typi=
cally those that experience low deliverability rates. As such, we cannot =
guarantee this as a reliable recovery method and this can pose a problem =
if it's a method you rely on when locked out of the account.

As you noticed, we don't do anything to prevent folks from adding an unsu=
pported phone number using the workaround you found. That said, users in =
these areas may find authenticating with a TOTP application offers a bett=
er experience:

#configuring-two-factor-authentication-using-a-totp-mobile-app

Hope this helps clarify, but let us know if you have any other questions.=


Best,
Robin

Hello,
I have found a bug in 2-factor authentiacation.
Please review, https://github.com/trishantexploits/GitHub_OTP_Exploit.
It allows sending OTP to countries that are not allowed in the list.

Thank you.
